# Final-Project-CS50xMiami
This is my final project I did last year for CS50x course at Miami Dade College. It is mainly built using php, mysql, bootstrap. This is a type of crm where you can input new clients, edit them, see upcoming birthdays and other information. It might work on not depending on the ide but at least the code is there.
